        <p> Hello everyone! I am originally from Venezuela, but I was raised in Miami,FL from a young age.
            I have moved multiple times accross the USA - including Madison, WI and Chicago. Oh yes, I'm also a Badger
            from the University of Wisconsin Madison!
        </p>
        <p> I'm currently a data solutions associate director at Horizon Media and my primary client is a movie studio called 
            STX Entertainment. I truly, and I mean <strong> truly</strong> enjoy mixing data, marketing, and entertainment into a melting pot. </p>
        <p> I'm also an entrepreneur, clothing designer, and hip-hop music producer/engineer on my spare time. 
            Ultimately, I just enjoy creating products from scratch and it was these hubbies that took me out of the habit of playing video games. </p>
        <p> I enjoy traveling to new destinations, going to concerts, and my favorite cusines are Peruvian, Indian, and Japanese. I look forward to getting to know y'all!</p>
